The UML to Java generator is intended for developpers who want to quickly generate source code structure from their UML file without having to be depedant from any specific IDE.

This is currently a beta version of the generator. Errors are to be expected.

The generator currently supports only uxf files. You can download the free open-source software UMLet to create uxf files.

The project uses the open source tinyxml2 library to parse uxf files which are written in xml. You can find the library here: https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2
